_N_o_t_e:

     Henderson and Velleman (1981) comment in a footnote to Table 1:
     ‘Hocking [original transcriber]'s noncrucial coding of the Mazda's
     rotary engine as a straight six-cylinder engine and the Porsche's
     flat engine as a V engine, as well as the inclusion of the diesel
     Mercedes 240D, have been retained to enable direct comparisons to
     be made with previous analyses.’
